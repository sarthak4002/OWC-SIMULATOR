# OWC-SIMULATOR
The OWC Simulator is a modular and interactive simulation environment designed to model, visualize, and analyze Optical Wireless Communication systems. This tool enables users to simulate the complete OWC linkâ€”from signal transmission through an LED (optical source), atmospheric noise interference (e.g., AWGN, scintillation)
